# FortiWEB Ingress Controller Release Notes

## 1.0.0
### What's New

 FortiWeb Ingress Controller combines the capabilities of an Kubernetes Ingress resource with the Ingress-managed loadbalancer, FortiWeb. FortiWeb, as the Ingress-managed load-balancer, not only provides flexibility in load-balancing, but also protects hosted web applications from attacks that target known and unknown exploits. Using multi-layered and correlated detection methods, FortiWeb defends applications from known vulnerabilities and zero-day threats. FortiWeb also offers a machine-learning function that enables it to automatically detect malicious web traffic. In addition to detecting known attacks, the feature can detect potential unknown zero-day attacks to provide real-time protection for web servers.
